Stuff That needed to be change or added / issues

Change on Spam the honypot funktion and use Realms Api to chekc how many ppl are in the Realm before joining it ( use const playerCount = await getCurrentPlayerCount(authFlow, realm.id);)
Bot has often Discord API issues 
Make consol look better 
Add a Link command so many ppl can use the bot whit there owen acc | Warning ! If you do this do NOT self host the src since ppl can get your Ip whit this or use an VPN
I Removed My Bot bypasses so they wont get patched + the partilce spam so you migh add back 
Ik the src is shitty so make it better instaed of yapping 
Swich to ERIS if bot is eating to much RAM (2.5-3.6 GB)
